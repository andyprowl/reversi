# Reversi

This is a simple *reversi* game developed in C++ with [Cinder](http://libcinder.org/).

# Rules

The rules of the game are quite simple and can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Rules). It is possible to restart a game at any time by hitting the F4, F6, F8, F10, or F12 keys. Hitting the Fn key will create a new game whose board has size n x n.
